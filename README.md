## Deployment & Forking & Cloning

## Setup the workspace
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) have been used to build the web page. Make sure you have them installed. 

The workspace should be setup as follows:
1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (Navigation Menu > Terminal > New Terminal)
2. Navigate to the location, where you would like to have the repository locally
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://code.visualstudio.com/`. Once the repository is successfully cloned, the repo folder is created.
4. Open VS from the repo folder. In order to setup your virtual environment, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) must be installed. setup the loval environment. Run ```python -m venv venv``` to create virtual environment and `pyenv local 3.12.0` to install python version for this application.
5. Use `.\venv\Scripts\activate` to active the virtual environment.
6. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Set up the database key for ElephantSQL Database, see [Setup Database](#setup-database)
8. Create `env.py` file to specify environment variables     
    - `SECRET_KEY` move the django secret key from `settings.py`
    - `DATABASE_URL` assign the generated database key
    - `os.environ["DEV"] = "True"`
    - `os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"`
9. Build the logic to use the ElphantSQL Database in production environment (i.e. on Heroku) and the local sqlite database when developing the application.


## Setup Database
1. Login to [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/instance), you see all created database instances.
2. Click on the green button 'Create New Instance' at the rigt top corner.
3. Fill out the form. Specify database name > Select Region > Leave the data center default > Review > Create Instance.
4. You will be redirected to the overview off all instaces, click on the created database instance to see details about database.
5. Copy the URL and assign it to the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` in `env.py`
