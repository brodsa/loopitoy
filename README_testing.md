### Testing Webhooks using Stripe CLI
- Follow [official documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) to setup Stripe CLI.
- Open PowerShell and use command `stripe login` to log in to your stripe account.
- To forward events to your webhook, type `stripe listen --forward to localhost:4242/webhook`
- Test different type of events, e.g. using `stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded`, more type events can be found [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/create?endpoint_location=local). 

**Report**
The Webhook was tested on development environment. Two type of events were tested: `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.payment_failed`. The outcome of testing is listed below
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed`: [terminal](./docs/testing/wh/wh_payment_failed_terminal.PNG), [dashboard](./docs/testing/wh/wh_payment_failed_dashboard.PNG)
  - `payment_intent.succeeded` : [terminal](./docs/testing/wh/wh_payment_successed_terminal.PNG), [dashboard](./docs/testing/wh/wh_payment_successed_dashboard.PNG), [cache data](./docs/testing/wh/cacha_data.PNG)

There were additional webhook test performed, see the report of Features Testing 


## Code Validation
The webpage was validated from several perspectives:
- the markup validity, see [HTML](#html).
- the css properties, see [CSS](#css).
- the web accessibility, see [Accessibility](#accessibility).
- the coding rules of the JavaScript source code, see [JavaScript](#javascript).
- the coding rules of Python source code, see [Python](#pep8).
- the more general quality of the webpage, see [Lighthouse](#lighthouse)


### HTML 
The [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) web-based tool by W3 was used to validate the pages of the webpage. The source code of pages was checked directly via text input or  via provided page URL. The validation detected several errors in the snippet code for the newsletter subscribtion. This code was copied directly from [mailchimp](https://us14.admin.mailchimp.com/). The below detailed reports ignore the [errors from mailchimp tool](./docs/testing/html/html_newsletter.PNG):

### Accessibility
The chrome extension [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) was considered for the evaluation of the web accessibility. The validation revealed missing `arial-label` attributes in profile and checkout form. These were added. The final detailed reports are below:
